http://github.com/jflam/kanvas

Getting Started

1. Install Silverlight 2

   Windows/Mac: http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/resources/install.aspx?v=2.0

   Run this executable, and restart any browsers you have open.

2. Download Silverlight Dynamic Languages SDK

   http://www.codeplex.com/sdlsdk/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=14254

   Scroll down, and select the "Dynamic Languages SDK". Extract sdk-sdk.zip
   into a folder named sdl-sdk at the same level as the kanvas folder.

3. Run at a command prompt:

   >>> sdl-sdk/script/server /b:kanvas/index.html

   This will open your default browser to the kanvas demo page.

4. Run some code:

   Take a look at Code.rb and drawing.rb; copy some of those method bodies, paste
   into the HTML page's textarea, click run, and see the canvas code in action!
